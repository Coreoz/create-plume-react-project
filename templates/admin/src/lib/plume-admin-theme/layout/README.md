# Benefits of Using Complex Reusable SCSS Module Templates in React.js

Implementing **reusable SCSS module templates** that handle **complex page layouts** across multiple components and views can significantly enhance your workflow. These templates are designed to format entire pages, offering extensive advantages over component-specific or inline styles.

With reusable SCSS module templates, you're building a robust and flexible front-end architecture, reducing redundancy, and streamlining your development process.

## 1. **Scalability and Structure for Large Applications**

When building large applications, it's critical to maintain a structured and **scalable CSS architecture**. Reusable SCSS module templates allow you to define the layout, grid systems, and responsive behaviors for entire pages, not just individual components.

- **Without reusable templates**: As the application grows, you may need to recreate complex layout styles for each new page, which can lead to bloated, repetitive, and hard-to-maintain styles.
- **With reusable templates**: You can centralize these complex layouts in SCSS modules and apply them consistently across multiple pages, ensuring scalability and ease of future expansion.

```scss
// search-layout.module.scss
.search-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
  gap: 20px;
}

.header {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  height: 60px;
  background-color: $primary-color;
}
```
```tsx
import scss from './search-layout.module.scss';

function SearchPage() {
  return (
    <div className={scss.pageLayout}>
      <header className={scss.header}>Header Content</header>
      <aside>Sidebar</aside>
      <main>Main Content</main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 2. **Consistency Across Pages**

When SCSS modules are designed to handle complex page layouts, they ensure visual consistency across different parts of your application. This is especially important for multi-page apps where you want to maintain the same layout, grid system, and overall look and feel.

- **Without reusable templates**: Developers may introduce subtle inconsistencies by implementing different layouts for different pages, leading to a fragmented user experience.
- **With reusable templates**: A complex SCSS module can enforce a standardized design system for entire pages, ensuring a uniform structure for navigation, content presentation, and responsiveness across all pages.

## 3. **Create your own template**

You must create a new template for each type of page your BO displays.

A first template was created for pages that displays a list and search around this list : '[search-layout.module.scss](search-layout.module.scss)./'

**Do not try** to override this template to handle another type of layout, just create another one.
